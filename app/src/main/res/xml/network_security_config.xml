    SECURITY: Network Security Configuration for MetroVault
    
    This configuration explicitly denies all network connections to reinforce
    the app's offline-only design. Even if INTERNET permission were accidentally
    added, this config would prevent connections from succeeding.
    
    Key settings:
    - cleartextTrafficPermitted="false": Blocks all HTTP connections
    - Empty trust-anchors: Refuses to trust any SSL/TLS certificates
-->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
        <trust-anchors>
            <!-- Intentionally empty: trust no certificates, deny all HTTPS -->
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
